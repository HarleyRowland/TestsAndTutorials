ElasticSearch is built using Java and the most recent one needs at least Java 8 to run.

ElasticSearch will not run if a known bad version of Java is used. 

Easiest way to download is through .tar.gz or .zip. Download the most recent ES and run the checksum. go to /bin/elasticSearch to run it. Make a GET Request to check it is running. 

All config files are found within /config/

You can make the user enter a value on startup for a config file by using {prompt.text} as the value for the config field.

You can pass values in at the command line: 
	./bin/elasticsearch -Edefault.node.name=My_Node

You should change the logs and data files to a different location so that they are not overwritten when we update.

Change the cluster name from the default (which is ElasticSearch)

Change the node name. 

We are set to use our local as the loopback IP but we should change this. A good non-loopback one is: network.host: 192.168.1.10

You need to provide a list of node ip and ports.

We need master nodes to prevent failure when communication drops. You set a minimum number of master nodes for a cluster so that a single cluster won't split into two and then data may be lost. 

ElasticSearch runs some bootstrap checks. If any fail in developement mode, the user is warned. If they fail in production, ElasticSearch won't start.

Developement is when ES is local, production is when ES has binded to an external interface.

Other stuff in this part was related to updating ES and errors related which can be looked into should they come up.
