All learnt based on the ElasticSearch Documentation

Basic bits: 
	It is near realtime
	A Cluster is a group of Nodes where the cluster of Nodes together hold all of your data. You index a Cluster as whole. A Node joins a 		Cluster by the Cluster's name.
	A Node is a search which holds some data. Unless specified, it will join a cluster called elasticsearch. 
	An index is like an area of data - a way of separating data.
	A type is a way of identifier what kind of document a document is. Our types are treatment summaries or drugs.
	A document is a unit of information which can be indexed. It is expressed as JSON and must have a type. 
	A shard is a subsection of an index but will act as an independent (although it works with the others - doesn't NEED them). A shard can be 		hosted on any node. This is good is will have a lot of data in an index which wouldn't necessarily fit all in one place. 
	A replica is a back for a shard. 

Easy to install, just need Java running and download. Run using elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch

We can do a health check using:
	GET /_cat/health?v

Which should return stuff related to the cluster including its name (by default elasticsearch) and its status:
	green is all is good.
	yellow is the cluster is working fine but no replicas have been allocated. 
	red means some data is not available. It will still work but should be fixed ASAP

We can get all nodes using: 
	GET /_cat/nodes?v

We can get all indices using: 
	GET /_cat/indices?v

We create an index using a PUT:
	PUT /customer?pretty

This adds a document with a name field and gives it the type external:
	PUT /customer/external/1
	{
	  "name": "John Doe"
	}

We get that document using:
	GET /customer/external/1

We can delete an index using:
	DELETE /customer?pretty

Elastic search will replace or input. So if we try to put another document into customer/external/1 it will replace the old one but if we did it with 2 instead, it will make a new record. 

Adding without an id i.e: 
	POST /customer/external
	{
	  	"name": "Jim Doe"
	}
Means that a random one will be used. The one for the above was "AVkg868zv07iib8-vceQ". Note that we need to use POST instead of PUT.
